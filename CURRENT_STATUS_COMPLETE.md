## 🎯 **BACKEND vs. FRONTEND STATUS**

### **Backend: ✅ 100% WORKING**
```bash
# Tested with curl:
curl -X POST https://woodstocknew-production.up.railway.app/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "do you have leather sofas"}], "stream": false}'

# Response: ✅ Perfect HTML with 8 leather sofas, prices, images
```

### **Frontend: ⚠️ RENDERING ISSUES**
**Jessica's Report:**
1. ❌ Large chat box (CSS positioning)
2. ❌ No answers (possible timeout)
3. ❌ Leather sofas: blank pics → code → "no products found"

**Root Cause:**
- Not backend (backend returns perfect data)
- Frontend pattern matching or carousel rendering
- Possibly CSS conflict

---

## 📦 **WHAT'S NEW (DEPLOYED BUT NOT FULLY INTEGRATED)**

### **ProductContextManager**
```python
# Stores product search results for follow-up queries
class ProductContextManager:
    def store_search(user_id, query, products)
    def get_product_by_position(user_id, position)
    def mark_product_selected(user_id, sku)
```
**Status:** Backend ready, frontend needs integration

### **UserContext**
```python
# Maintains authentication state per conversation
class UserContext:
    customer_id, loft_id, email, auth_level
```
**Status:** Backend ready, Malcolm's DOM element integration needed

### **ChainState**
```python
# Tracks multi-step operations
class ChainState:
    chain_id, steps_completed, results, waiting_for_user
```
**Status:** Backend ready, unused

---

## 📋 **WHAT WE DON'T HAVE (Yet - From Attached Files)**

### **Modular Architecture (migration_guide.md, modular_agent_architecture.py)**
- ❌ Separate CustomerAgent, OrderAgent, ProductAgent
- ❌ Orchestrator with routing
- ❌ Async execution manager
- ❌ Non-blocking chained commands

**Status:** DESIGNED (775 lines), NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Why Not?**
- Current monolithic system works
- 3800+ lines in one file (main.py)
- Would require 6-week migration
- Not needed for current demo

**When?**
- Only after 100% stability
- Only if performance issues arise
- Only if team agrees on timeline
