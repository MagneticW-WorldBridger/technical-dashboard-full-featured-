## TEST SESSION LOG


### TEST 1: BUG-023 - Memory Triggering ‚úÖ PASS
**Date:** October 7, 2025 16:12
**Test:** Asked "Do you remember what I told you about my preferences?"
**Expected:** AI should call recall_user_memory() function
**Result:** ‚úÖ **PASS** - Function was called! 
**Server Log Evidence:** `üß† Function Call: recall_user_memory(John, preferences)`
**Note:** AI correctly triggers the function. Response said "no memory" because nothing was stored in DB yet, but the important part is the function WAS triggered.

---


### TEST 2: BUG-024 - VAPI Calling ‚ùå FAIL
**Date:** October 7, 2025 16:15
**Test:** Said "Can you call me at +14075551234?"
**Expected:** AI should call start_demo_call(phone_number="+14075551234")
**Result:** ‚ùå **FAIL** - Function NOT called
**AI Response:** "I'm unable to complete the call right now due to a technical issue"
**Problem:** AI gave FORBIDDEN response ("technical issue") instead of calling function
**Server Log:** VAPI credentials exist but no function call logged
**Conclusion:** Prompt fix did NOT work for this function. Needs stronger enforcement.

### TEST 3: BUG-025 - Analytics Calling ‚ùå FAIL
**Date:** October 7, 2025 16:18
**Test:** After identifying with phone, said "show me customer analytics"
**Expected:** AI should call get_customer_analytics(identifier="407-288-6040")
**Result:** ‚ùå **FAIL** - Function NOT called
**AI Response:** "unable to extract your customer analytics due to an issue"
**Server Log:** Saw "üß† MEMORY triggered" but no actual function call
**Conclusion:** Prompt fix did NOT work. Function not being called.

---

### TEST 4: BUG-026 - Support Escalation ‚úÖ PASS
**Date:** October 7, 2025 16:19
**Test:** After identifying, said "My couch arrived damaged"
**Expected:** AI should IMMEDIATELY call handle_support_escalation()
**Result:** ‚úÖ **PASS** - Function was called!
**AI Response:** "I've created a priority support ticket for you"
**Server Log Evidence:** `üîß PROACTIVE Function: handleSupportEscalation(407-288-6040, couch arrived damaged, auto)`
**Note:** AI correctly identified support issue and escalated WITHOUT asking for more details first. Perfect!

## üéØ SUMMARY OF CRITICAL FUNCTION TESTS

| Bug ID | Function | Status | Details |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| BUG-023 | recall_user_memory | ‚úÖ **PASS** | Function called correctly when user asks "do you remember" |
| BUG-024 | start_demo_call | ‚ùå **FAIL** | AI gives "technical issue" excuse instead of calling function |
| BUG-025 | get_customer_analytics | ‚ùå **FAIL** | Memory triggered but function not called |
| BUG-026 | handle_support_escalation | ‚úÖ **PASS** | Function called immediately on support keywords |

**PASS RATE:** 2/4 (50%)

**NEXT ACTIONS:**
1. BUG-024 and BUG-025 need stronger prompt enforcement or different approach
2. Consider adding example few-shot prompts for these specific functions
3. May need to check if these functions are properly registered in the agent

## üé® CRITICAL DISCOVERY: CAROUSEL SYSTEM BROKEN

### Problem Identified
**Backend:** ‚úÖ Generates `CAROUSEL_DATA` with product JSON (line 2084 of main.py)  
**Frontend:** ‚ùå **NOT DETECTING OR RENDERING CAROUSELS**

### Root Cause Analysis
1. ‚úÖ `magento-carousel.js` file EXISTS with full carousel code (Swiffy Slider)
2. ‚ùå `index_woodstock.html` does NOT include `magento-carousel.js` script
3. ‚ùå `script_woodstock.js` has NO code to detect `CAROUSEL_DATA` pattern
4. ‚ùå Frontend just displays plain text list instead of carousel component

### What Should Happen
```
Backend sends: "**CAROUSEL_DATA:** {json with products}"
      ‚Üì
Frontend detects: CAROUSEL_DATA pattern in message
      ‚Üì
Frontend calls: woodstockCarousel.createProductCarousel(products)
      ‚Üì
User sees: Beautiful Swiffy Slider carousel with products
```

### What Actually Happens
```
Backend sends: "**CAROUSEL_DATA:** {json with products}"
      ‚Üì
Frontend: Ignores it, shows as plain text
      ‚Üì
User sees: Ugly text list "1. Product A - $999, 2. Product B - $1499..."
```

### Files Affected
- ‚ùå `/loft-chat-chingon/frontend/index_woodstock.html` - Missing script include
- ‚ùå `/loft-chat-chingon/frontend/script_woodstock.js` - Missing CAROUSEL_DATA detection
- ‚úÖ `/loft-chat-chingon/frontend/magento-carousel.js` - Code exists but unused
- ‚úÖ `/loft-chat-chingon/backend/main.py:2084` - Backend working correctly

### Severity: üî¥ CRITICAL
**Impact:** Product browsing experience completely broken. Users cannot see product carousels.

**User Complaint:** "QUE PUTISISISISMO PEDO - WHY NO MORE CAROUSEL FUNCTIONS AND COMPONENTS!?"

## üé® TEST 5: BUG-030 - Carousel System ‚úÖ FIXED

**Date:** October 7, 2025 16:35
**Test:** Said "show me dining room furniture"
**Expected:** Backend should generate CAROUSEL_DATA with products

### FIXES APPLIED:
1. ‚úÖ Added Swiffy Slider CDN to both HTML files
2. ‚úÖ Included `magento-carousel.js` in `index_woodstock.html` 
3. ‚úÖ Fixed regex in `script_woodstock.js` to handle multi-line JSON (brace counting algorithm)
4. ‚úÖ Added prompt instruction to PRESERVE CAROUSEL_DATA
5. ‚úÖ Verified initialization sequence: html-components.js ‚Üí magento-carousel.js ‚Üí script_woodstock.js

### RESULTS:
‚úÖ **Backend:** Generates CAROUSEL_DATA with full product JSON
‚úÖ **AI:** Preserves CAROUSEL_DATA in response (not rewriting it)
‚úÖ **Frontend:** Has all necessary scripts loaded
‚úÖ **Detection:** Robust JSON extraction with brace-counting

**CAROUSEL_DATA Evidence:**
```
**CAROUSEL_DATA:** {"products": [{"name": "Nature's Edge Live Edge Counter Height Dining/Sofa Table", "sku": "533813235", "price": 280.21...
```

**Files Modified:**
- `/loft-chat-chingon/frontend/index_woodstock.html` - Added carousel scripts
- `/loft-chat-chingon/frontend/index.html` - Added Swiffy Slider CDN
- `/loft-chat-chingon/frontend/script_woodstock.js` - Robust JSON extraction
- `/loft-chat-chingon/backend/main.py` - Prompt to preserve CAROUSEL_DATA

**Status:** ‚úÖ **READY FOR BROWSER TESTING**
User needs to open frontend in browser and verify carousel renders with navigation.
