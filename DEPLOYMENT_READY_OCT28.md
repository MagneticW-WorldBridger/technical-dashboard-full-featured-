## 🔥 **HOW TO DEPLOY**

### **Step 1: Backup Current System**
```bash
cd /Users/coinops/Code/woodstock-technical-chatbot-full-featured
git add .
git commit -m "backup: Pre-deployment snapshot"
```

### **Step 2: Start Development Server**
```bash
cd loft-chat-chingon/backend
python3 main.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ ProductContextManager initialized (max_searches=5, ttl=1800s)
✅ nest-asyncio applied - TaskGroup errors fixed!
📁 Frontend mounted at /frontend from ...
🔧 Initializing PydanticAI agent with memory...
```

### **Step 3: Test New Features**

#### **Test 1: Product Context (BUG-022 Fix)**
```bash
# In chat:
User: "search grey sofas"
System: Shows 8 sofas
User: "show me the second one"
Expected: ✅ Correct product details (not error)
```

#### **Test 2: URL Authentication**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what are my orders"}],
    "customer_id": "12345",
    "loft_id": "ABC123",
    "auth_level": "authenticated"
  }'

Expected: ✅ System uses customer_id for lookup
```

#### **Test 3: Chained Command**
```bash
# In chat:
User: "tell me everything about customer 555-1234"
Expected: ✅ Complete journey (customer + orders + patterns + recs)
```

#### **Test 4: Context Retention (BUG-032 Fix)**
```bash
# In chat:
User: "search sectionals"
User: "what's my zip code?"
User: "show me the first sectional"
Expected: ✅ System remembers search results
```

## 📊 **SYSTEM HEALTH INDICATORS**

### **Monitor These Logs:**
```bash
# Successful context tracking:
📦 Stored search context: 'grey sofa' with 8 products for user X

# Successful authentication:
👤 UserContext created: 12345 (level: authenticated)

# Successful chain execution:

❌ Could not extract customer ID    # Issue with LOFT API response
⏰ Last search expired               # User context TTL exceeded (30min)
❌ Chain execution failed            # Multi-step workflow error
```

## 📈 **PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS**

### **Before (Old System):**
- Product context: ❌ Not tracked
- Authentication: ❌ Not supported

## 🔧 **ROLLBACK PROCEDURE**

If deployment fails:

```bash
cd /Users/coinops/Code/woodstock-technical-chatbot-full-featured
git restore loft-chat-chingon/backend/main.py
git restore loft-chat-chingon/backend/schemas.py
git restore "loft-chat-chingon/Bug List - SCRUM_BUG_TRACKER.csv"

# Restart server
cd loft-chat-chingon/backend
python3 main.py
```

**Rollback time:** < 30 seconds

---

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Minimum Viable Success:**
- ✅ Server starts without errors
- ✅ Existing functions still work
- ✅ No regressions in production features

### **Full Success:**
- ✅ All 4 test scenarios pass
- ✅ ProductContext stores searches correctly
- ✅ URL authentication creates UserContext
- ✅ Chained command executes multi-step workflow
- ✅ Context retained across conversation turns

### **Exceptional Success:**
- ✅ Zero bugs reported in first 24 hours
- ✅ Improved user satisfaction (faster responses)
- ✅ Analytics show chain execution usage
- ✅ Photo lookup success rate increases

---

## 📞 **SUPPORT & ESCALATION**

### **If Issues Occur:**

**Issue 1: Server won't start**
```bash
# Check syntax:
python3 -m py_compile loft-chat-chingon/backend/main.py

# Check dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Check logs:
tail -f loft-chat-chingon/backend/server.log
```

**Issue 2: Context not tracking**
```bash
# Check logs for:
📦 Stored search context  # Should appear after searches
💾 Stored user context    # Should appear in chat endpoint

# If missing, verify:
- ProductContextManager initialized: Line 246
- store_search() called: Line 2236
- set_user_context() called: Line 3121
```

**Issue 3: Authentication not working**
```bash
# Verify request includes auth fields:
{
  "customer_id": "12345",
  "loft_id": "ABC",
  "email": "user@example.com"
}

# Check logs for:
👤 UserContext created: X (level: authenticated)
```

## 🎓 **TRAINING NOTES (For Team)**

### **New Features to Communicate:**

1. **Product Context Tracking**
   - System now remembers searches
   - Users can reference "first one", "second one"
   - Photos work with position references

2. **Authenticated Sessions**
   - Frontend can pass customer_id in request
   - Enables personalized experiences
   - Automatic customer recognition

3. **Chained Commands**
   - New function: `get_complete_customer_journey()`
   - Returns comprehensive customer profile
   - Faster than separate calls

### **User Messaging:**
```
"We've improved how I remember your searches! 
Now you can say 'show me the second one' and 
I'll know exactly which product you mean."

"For authenticated users, I can now automatically 
recognize you and show personalized recommendations 
based on your order history."

"I can now get complete customer insights in one step, 
making it faster to help you with any questions."
```

## 🔒 **SECURITY & COMPLIANCE**

### **Authentication Security:**
- ✅ customer_id, loft_id, email passed from trusted frontend
- ✅ No passwords stored or transmitted
- ✅ Auth level validation before privileged operations
- ⚠️ **NOTE:** This is URL-based auth - NOT cryptographic
- 📝 **TODO:** Add JWT tokens for production security

### **Data Privacy:**
- ✅ Context stored in-memory only (not persisted)
- ✅ 30-minute TTL on product context
- ✅ 1-hour TTL on chain state
- ✅ No PII stored outside conversation memory
- ✅ GDPR-compliant (automatic expiration)

### **Thread Safety:**
- ✅ UserContext: Lock-protected
- ✅ ChainState: Lock-protected
- ⚠️ ProductContext: Not lock-protected (single-threaded assumed)
- 📝 **TODO:** Add locks if scaling to multi-process
