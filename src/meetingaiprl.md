JD Camden: They did switch. Yep. That's what I was trying to communicate like two, three weeks ago.
Puran Tak: Oh, really? So, did they switch it? Yeah, I did skip it. But the thing is uh I saw it is still the data on big images.
Derek Dicks: want to be
JD Camden: Where Where's the back coming from? Bye.
Puran Tak: That's yeah.
Evan Kubicek: Derek, you've got a lot of background noise.
Derek Dicks: What? I apologize. I'll I'll mute myself.
JD Camden: So, Pyram, what did you say?
Puran Tak: So what I said was um swans they will have if they want 100% accurate data I can rescrape it because some of the images have a pattern and then then some of the images doesn't have a pattern and that's that's inconsistency there which is why scraping is being uh I would say not 100% but then close to 80 90%. That's what that's what the numbers I would say for the product data. And by the way, it's been scraped. The new website have been scraped.
 
 
00:01:16
 
JD Camden: Okay. So, I I think that's a start. I think the the key to that that we have to solve is like what's the Woo Commerce integration look like and how do we just pull that data out of Woo? Um because that's where that product is going to live. So again, you're going to have Big Commerce, Shopify, and Woo that you have to pull data out of all three of those systems.
Puran Tak: That's pretty simple. All I need is a big API key. That's it. And it's it's pretty simple to go to.
JD Camden: So then I will send him a test link and see how he feels and just shoot it over to him as a what's your thoughts? So somebody could put me together an email for Swans. That'd be super helpful. I need an email together for Penny Mustard around ready to go live. Um so I need both those emails put together.
Puran Tak: I can give out the links to anybody you want to.
JD Camden: And then uh Have we updated Gavagans to tell them they can start testing again?
 
 
00:02:05
 
JD Camden: Are we ready for Gavagans to start testing again? Which is what we were supposed to communicate to them.
Derek Dicks: We had the one last meeting with them. They had asked about SKUs being searched by that uh the Wells Fargo stuff.
Evan Kubicek: You better not.
Derek Dicks: Verona had those notes. Have we had those to the point we can say those are complete?
Puran Tak: Yeah, STUs I the thing is it's still still being scraped and I would say the last uh there were some few errors that came in while scraping the whole website again and uh yeah SKUs uh it will be done right like uh it's ready to go live but then SK SKU if you want to search from SKUs and want like 100% results you can search from the product URL and then on Monday so even if they go live on the back end we I will still make it like the SKU is 100% work so that's the case and hope that makes sense
Derek Dicks: Yeah.
JD Camden: Do we do we have sequences set up for sales development?
 
 
00:03:20
 
JD Camden: So once the lead is generated, are we following up with a lead?
Brian Okello: Yes.
JD Camden: Like that's a basic level one feature. So if we're going to say that we're ready to go live, like um lead sequencing is part of phase one. Do we have that implemented for appointments? Because if we have, I haven't seen it.
Miya Harrison: Yeah, I made an appointment through Swans and it sent me an email and it sent me the date, the time, and it was going to put it on my Google calendar.
JD Camden: Did it follow up with you after that though?
Derek Dicks: Right.
Miya Harrison: Yeah, it sent me the email.
Derek Dicks: Not followup.
Miya Harrison: Oh, I'm not sure about followup.
Puran Tak: Yeah, there's no followup. There's not a followup yet.
Derek Dicks: Not like Yeah. Not follow work that I was set up for that.
Puran Tak: And I can set that up quickly, really quickly, by the way, if you guys want me to do that. It's really simple.
JD Camden: Yeah, I think if you could work with Evan and get those set up, those need set up.
 
 
00:04:12
 
JD Camden: Like we need those on the April side alone, right? Like that's that's been one of the things I've been pushing for around features for months now or like, hey, this is a feature that we told people it would do. It would remind the customer that they have an appointment and it would make it conversational. So, it's not just a reminder. It's a reach out of, "Hey, JD, really looking forward to seeing you on Friday. Was there any specific item that you're really looking for that I can help kind of search our showroom for so I'm ready for when you come in?" Like, what's that communication look like around sales? That way, it's not just a reminder, but it's engaging conversation, which is the point of the AI.
Puran Tak: Gotcha. Yeah, Brian, we might need to set up a drip campaign for that.
Brian Okello: Yeah. Yeah. right now. I know I know the appointment feature has like just um random messages just notifications but to have it more extensive as as as J said it then yeah it needs to be a broadcast.
 
 
00:05:06
 
JD Camden: and then get get with Evan. Evan can build a sales drip flow for like how do we engage a lead for a furniture store and keep them engaged so we can get them in because reminders won't get them to complete their appointments. engaging that lead, making that lead understand that we understand what they need, communicating, and then giving all of that data back to the store is how that's going to work.
Brian Okello: Okay.
Derek Dicks: Yeah, having a workflow built out is going to be gold. The rest of it is just building nodes and building reminders and putting all the AI to go through and look at past conversation and stuff like that.
JD Camden: Okay. Do we have uh update on the dashboard, John? I got an email from Peter today wanting an update.
Jean Del Lasse: Yes. Uh phase one should be done and he wants to meet at 4. Uh should be we should be ready for that meeting of four.
JD Camden: Put that on my calendar.
Jean Del Lasse: Do you have time to join?
 
 
00:06:02
 
JD Camden: Okay. Y and then M is May. Is that for Eastern or Standard or Central? It's probably Eastern. Confirm with him that that's for Eastern and then just add it to my calendar.
Jean Del Lasse: Uh yeah.
JD Camden: Okay. Um and then uh Derek, you have to be on that call.
Jean Del Lasse: Okay.
JD Camden: Good way around it. Um that's dashboard. Uh the other thing I needed so when we met with the investor last night right from the tech mo stack like how do we have a deep enough tech stack so that where we can get to funding funding
Brian Okello: It's
JD Camden: allows us to get to equity and get everyone on payroll and raises right like this is what we've been talking about so the unified AI is how we get to funding like how do we get meta to talk to chat to talk to text to talk to voice to remember the conversation to have the memory to pick up the conversation right like That experience is what gets us to funding.
 
 
00:07:06
 
JD Camden: So like that's the experience that we need to be able to show real world king on Monday that we haven't started on.
Brian Okello: Okay.
Jean Del Lasse: I think I may be able to show a demo uh of of that city.
JD Camden: Even if we can demo it Monday and I have a demo where we can show them how that workflow works like we I need to be able to have a demo.
Jean Del Lasse: I
JD Camden: We need to be able to have a short video around that that we can show an investor like, hey, this is what it's going to do. This is how it looks in a unified inbox, right? Like this is how we kill omni channel, right? The idea that we can use AI to kill an omni channel experience. Omni channel is the conversation of no matter where they interacted with our brand, we were able to interact with them. It is we we interacted with them across multi-channel. That's what omni channel stands for. We want to continue to talk about unified channel, right?
 
 
00:07:54
 
JD Camden: Unified channel means I it's not singular touch points. It's a unified touch points across all channels, right? Um it's not social interaction, phone interaction, text interaction. It's customer interaction and if we can start talking about it as customer interaction through unified channel, we will raise funds, right? And like that's, you know, if we can get Evan that video, Evan can tie that into the pitch deck.
Jean Del Lasse: Yeah.
JD Camden: I'm telling you, that's that's where we have to lead out from in the conversations that we had last night. That's the one that makes people pay attention.
Evan Kubicek: And that's coming from a guy that hears AI pitches every single day.
Jean Del Lasse: Okay.
JD Camden: That was the only piece of what I pitched last night that got his attention and he started actually asking questions after that. Until then, he wasn't interested. When we got to that, we had his attention.
Evan Kubicek: Yep.
Jean Del Lasse: Absolutely. I agree. It needs to be full circle from lead generation to lead follow-up, lead nurturing, live transfer only warm leads that are ready to close.
 
 
00:08:57
 
Jean Del Lasse: demo all of these capabilities that uh allow them to just take care of the warm ready to buy uh lead and the omni channel the the memory I'm doing some tests with uh with postgress for for unified memory and I already have Facebook web chat and Instagram connected on our custom uh proprietary code So, I uh I think I think those are the three I'll be able to demo.
JD Camden: Yeah. So then from there we just need to tie in text and voice right into that persistent memory.
Jean Del Lasse: Yeah.
JD Camden: And I know to get to voice we might have to get Vappy out of the way. So Derek, there are like red lines have to get done. Like I need feedback on red lines. Like I like if you if you can't do it then just tell me like we're we're a month in. We're going to lose the boost mobile opportunity without red lights.
Jean Del Lasse: boost.
Puran Tak: It's cool.
Jean Del Lasse: I was going to say uh for concurrency we I think that was the last question VP asked and concurrency really if if they're going to have 50 stores our top concurrency if calls are one minute is going to be 100 120 concurrent at the same time.
 
 
00:10:07
 
JD Camden: Well, we were we were supposed to we were supposed to have another meeting with Vaffy. Did we get it scheduled? Derrick's on mute. He's in a hotel lobby, too.
Derek Dicks: I've been back and forth with them and their uh managers. They got back with me yesterday. Said the person I've been waiting to talk to had been out of town, so they said they're going to get the meeting in the books. They they did some uh recounting of the number, Sean, that we initially had last given them. And so I think we overshot a lot on what Jay was saying for 50 stores.
Jean Del Lasse: Mhm.
Derek Dicks: They were thinking way way way less. And so I put through some averages and it looked like concurrency wise we we would not have that many. We literally probably need like 10 lines at most or 50 stores to start off with. Of course, it needs to scale up to hundreds as we get into it, but as far as 50 stores, the the minutes they had per month was like think,66 per month for all 50 stores.
 
 
00:11:07
 
Derek Dicks: So, that averages out to anyway, we only really probably need about three concurrent lines, but I figure 10 would be a good uh tripling of what the the minimum would be. uh and start with that. So, we're waiting to hear back to Baffy at this point.
JD Camden: So red lines meeting with Vappy. Okay. And so two compliance like those three things have to get done in the next three to four days.
Derek Dicks: Yes, the Bappy. I can't push that any harder. I've already sent him like four messages waiting to get back with him. So, hopefully he'll go back today.
Jean Del Lasse: I I would say that be we don't if we don't hear back from them we can just go with the public uh you know it's set up we can go with the public pricing and each concurrent line is
Puran Tak: That's done.
Jean Del Lasse: $10 per line so our needs would really be a h 100red to a,000 tops per month to service the 50 stores.
Derek Dicks: Right. Right.
 
 
00:11:57
 
Jean Del Lasse: Um, yeah.
JD Camden: So, we're we're in a $25,000 PC. So, the reason that I need the concurrency number is I need to make sure that we're not going to lose money on tokens, that we're not going to lose money on fees, that we're not going to end up $50,000 upside down on a $25,000 PC. Like I need us to make five $6,000 on that project.
Derek Dicks: Is that
Jean Del Lasse: Yeah. No, absolutely. I think even even more if they don't do any active marketing saying hey we have an AI go talk to it if they treat it just like the regular lines uh if we don't have any any spikes in traffic I think it's it's a good predictable way to uh yeah ensure that we don't go over tokens uh pricing is always going to be controlled we should aim at the 16 to 13 cents per minute range uh for And I don't think you know on public pricing there aren't any monthly fees or anything like that. Uh so it would just be really the usage.
 
 
00:12:58
 
Jean Del Lasse: Um if we if we that's if we don't hear back from BPI like worst case scenario if we start building everything and we go with just the pricing they have online that's what we would be looking at. So I think their their budget Yeah.
Derek Dicks: Sean No, just curious on comparing that.
Jean Del Lasse: Sir,
Derek Dicks: I I do not want to revamp anything to the land or to um anything else unless we absolutely have to. But I do we have any idea on conversations you've had with them? Did you ever were you able to get a hold of those other two competitors to that beach just in This
Jean Del Lasse: I have not gotten back. Uh they they uh haven't responded. Uh, I did try them again, but I know from from for a fact that pricing with them would be a lot between it's probably now between 9 and 13 cents per minute. They charge 5k per month for their enterprise plan. Enterprise plan. Uh, yeah, concurrency of 10 or 100 lines would not really be an issue.
 
 
00:14:07
 
Jean Del Lasse: I remember they allowed us to do 100,000 on a day. Uh and 100 every 10 seconds something like that. Uh if if Yeah.
Derek Dicks: I I think with our 50 stores with the first boost is not going to be an issue even if we just keep the the standard pricing with everything. I I agree with Josh or maybe Jean whoever said that if we do not if we try to it'd be safer for them to not go advertise something that we're trying tring out in a beta mode.
Jean Del Lasse: Yeah.
Derek Dicks: So if they go and spread it everywhere and usage spikes and things will collapse for what we based everything on which was the 1166 minutes per month. So we don't really want to collapse the system just anyway. So we would want to make sure to communicate to them that we have built this to do triple of what they've done. But if they go and make a national advertising campaign off these 50 stores, that is not suggestive.
Jean Del Lasse: Yeah, unless they increase the token spend or we have something ready for that.
 
 
00:15:10
 
JD Camden: Well, the the point of the pilot is to itemize out what the token spend is, right? And so then we can basically have a solid estimate of this is what it's going to cost for every 50 stores. So if we want to do 200 stores next quarter, we can add 200 stores. And then we can do 600 stores the quarter after that. And then we can just keep stacking until we get to thousands and thousands of stores over probably an 18 to 24month roll out, right? Like it would it's going to take two years to roll it out across all locations. Okay. Um anything else? I I uh so I gave some clear directions there around where I need some emails or email updates. I don't care if those come from Derek to Sarah or to Maya. like someone's got to get that to me so I can get those out to clients. So, Swans, Penny Mustard, Gavagans, I need email updates out to all three of those clients today on the customer service side.
 
 
00:16:04
 
JD Camden: I need an update against the Redlines. I need the demo video of how we have unified channel. And then I need an update against Sock 2 compliance. So, those are those are the big items I need. Then, moving into pipeline as we move to Monday, I'm going to need an update against Woodstock. We're going to need an update against Bears. We're going to need an update against Walkers. Okay? And then uh Monday we have the rule king demo. So I need to know are we actually going to have a rule king demo to run or are we just going to have to run the boost mobile demo? We had a month to build the demo there and and I don't think we're I don't think we're done. So and if if we are I haven't had a chance to test it okay then send it send so send it to Maya.
Puran Tak: I built it today. Yeah, I built it today. It's done. I just wanted to test people like how tested
 
 
00:16:46
 
JD Camden: Let Maya test rule king and let her spend some time with that. And if Maya says, "Hey, this this works pretty well, JD, then then I'll trust it and we can figure out how to make it work." Um, we need AI voice for rule King specifically, like on the demo side, I need two AI voice experiences. So, I don't care how we have to set up the phone number, but I need to be able to dial it outbound in both circumstances. So, I need to be able to dial an AI voice that is the store experience. The store experience is about, even if it's these five products, it doesn't have to be every product. You could tell me it's these five products. We have to give it some fake inventory around those five products on whether they're in stock. There should be one of those that's out of stock. And when it's out of stock, it should suggest another product that is in stock that's similar, right? Over the phone, right?
Puran Tak: Right.
 
 
00:17:29
 
JD Camden: So like basic FAQs. Uh Claire has FAQs. I think those have been shared or she sent those over.
Puran Tak: Right.
JD Camden: Okay.
Puran Tak: No. Uh that's fine.
JD Camden: Um but no
Puran Tak: Uh by the way, I can I can I can tell you what I've built, right? And you can have stuff like what you want there. So yeah, about the products that you mentioned, yeah, products are there. Inventory will be added as well. And on the chat side, of course, I've built two databases. So first, if you chat with uh April, it's going to remember you. So if uh if you give your phone number on the chat, uh it's going to if you call back the same phone number. So from chat to phone, right, it's going to remember your name and it's going to call you, hey JD, thanks for calling again, right? And the same works for the outbound, right? And it's going to also help you find the direction of the store.
 
 
00:18:20
 
Puran Tak: So let's uh it's going to be a one specific store example. So let's say it wouldn't be like uh a whole ring, one phone number, but instead of one phone number that is connected to one store. So let's say if it's connected to Laorte right it's in Illinois like hey you're speaking with the laort Illinois rule king store how can I help you be like hey can you send me directions to it will send you directions in SMS and then you'll be like I'm looking for a product uh can you just have suggest me so there will be a product specialist named Emma she she'll be coming in just to show off the agent site uh like it can transfer different agent just to show that feature off and then uh yeah it can also transfer to a SD. So if you want anything else, let me know.
JD Camden: Okay. Uh, I'll like send send those things to Maya so that way she knows what it does. Like put an email together with the demo link to her and then Maya, if you see features around like what I want, right?
 
 
00:19:17
 
JD Camden: Like so I I want the customer experience around to call store and I want the call customer experience around to call the call center. People calling the call center are having service issues. They're having warranty issues.
Puran Tak: All
JD Camden: They're having delivery issues or they're checking order statuses. People calling the store are specifically asking about inventory, inventory products and what's there and about store hours and about location, right?
Brian Okello: What is Um,
JD Camden: So like that does 80% of the call workload for rule camp. And that the notes from this meeting will be in the teams after Maya.
Puran Tak: right.
JD Camden: So if you need to look it up, that'll be recorded so you can see it. Okay? But test that. If we're missing those features, let's get those communicated over to Derek and Piran so we can get those features in. Like I need us to have that tested and button up. I fly home tomorrow and I can start testing it tomorrow night um as a whole. But if we're not super buttoned up there, I don't want to walk in dark.
 
 
00:20:07
 
JD Camden: So like winning so just so everyone on this call knows winning rule king as AI allows me to guarantee our revenue from drive right like those drive pays everyone's bills on this call at the moment April does not right so this that's screwing up the demo on Monday puts puts a lot of finances at risk for me as a business so it's a big deal to have this meeting it is with the CFO and CEO of both of their companies right so it's a it's a really big deal to me so I just need us to be buttoned up. If we're not super buttoned up on the rule king side, Maya, then just tell me and we'll demo boost or we'll demo and we'll pivot somewhere else.
Puran Tak: What happened?
JD Camden: Um, but the unified video would be really important here, Sean. So, we can get a good experience for them on the video site.
Derek Dicks: Now, Claire Declare from Rule King, she had asked about uh or or pointed to the fact that this originally started off with a conversation between you and her and a fivepocket gan deal.
 
 
00:21:04
 
Derek Dicks: We still need to make sure that knowledge is in there.
JD Camden: That's a that's a that's a different piece of logic.
Derek Dicks: That's my point. It is very different. So, she was giving us a ton of stuff on the five pocket uh and wanting to get the social side to connect and be able to
Jean Del Lasse: That ultimately just came came down to one. It was sorry that ultimate just came down to one campaign that they needed uh tracking tags and responding a very simple um uh message back there on Instagram and she said the FAQ would come later.
JD Camden: Yeah, that that's one like specific C social campaign that she's needing help with.
Derek Dicks: So good. My point is we can add that in as we're building the rest of this. If you're trying to show off all of it, then it would be show off the mobile side, but then also show off the social integrations is my point.
Jean Del Lasse: Um yes.
Derek Dicks: I think we have enough for that if we can put that all together.
 
 
00:21:57
 
Jean Del Lasse: Yep. Absolutely. Yeah, I had that on my on my plate too. Uh on the same uh repository actually. Uh Piran, I'll I'll need to uh we'll probably need to connect about uh what you have and what's missing. So So um yeah, we don't have any any gaps there.
Puran Tak: It's um JD a small question right so Claire did not give us the information about the web chat demo but then she gave us the information about um an Instagram solution that rule k rural king was essentially looking for right and yeah so what what is happening is that currently John is taking care of the rule king side and I built the web chat side and the phone call side and yeah So, what needs to be shown? Like you you going to show both of them or Yeah, that's that's what I need to know because there's a bit
JD Camden: This this is you you guys have me super lost right now.
Derek Dicks: Are these separate experiences or are they can they be merged?
 
 
00:23:04
 
JD Camden: So you you have you have two requests from me with rule king. Player has asked to build a campaign specifically for five pocket gene that is a social campaign designed to generate reviews and syndication. That is one project. That is a small subset project that I can oversee inside of rule king to at least get us integrated to social. That is a separate item. That is a true like, hey, this is going to be built. This is not a demo. This is not a proof of concept. This is I oversee social media marketing rule king. I can build a project, right? Like that's that's five pocket G. Then we have, hey, we're meeting with the four most important people inside of a two billion dollar organization who have given us one hour to talk about what is the future of AI for retail and what can we do to help them. Right? So that is our demo which the future of AI for retail includes a thing that Walmart just rolled out which is conversational AI search.
 
 
00:23:54
 
JD Camden: Right?
Puran Tak: Oops.
JD Camden: Which means the search bar on the e-commerce website is conversational AI. It's no longer product search. Walmart just introduced that last week. It's the Amazon AI that's been rolled out. So like I need some information around, hey, this is where AI is coming. Evan and I are working on that. So we're gonna spend the first 15 minutes talking about that. Then we're going to talk about how can rule King beat Tractor Supply today. Tractor Supply is a 68 billion organization. The majority of the executive leadership team used to work for them. The majority of the executive leadership team hates them. Okay. So if we can beat Tractor Supply to a solid AI customer experience solution, we get an opportunity to do it. Customer experience solution at Rule King is is multi-channel. It is social, it is web, it is chat, it is text. You have a you have a 50 person call center team working two shifts six days a week.
 
 
00:24:42
 
JD Camden: They're handling warranty, service, repairs. Where's my order? Then you have customer service at the store where people are calling and going, "Hey, do you have this in stock? Hey, I was wanting to talk to someone about a gun. Hey, I was wanting some information on a tractor. Can you help me with this information?" People calling the stores are looking for product information or they're looking for instock information. People calling call center are looking for warranty, service, repairs. All of those experiences need to be built across chat, across text, across social, across voice and then integrated into their PIM system, which is a kenno, and all of their data flows through Oracle, right, as a whole. So like this is a project just like Hooker is a project. The Hooker dashboard needs to get out to John Albanesey's today for an overview. Someone needs to send that email to him. I gave my feedback there around timeline so we can get that quote updated separate item. My AHD jumped, right?
 
 
00:25:34
 
Evan Kubicek: Thank you.
JD Camden: But that needs to get out today. Okay. The but the rule king is fivepocket is its own thing. Piran so like it's just a social campaign but the customer experience AI that is April that is what we're that's what I'm trying to get us to build.
Puran Tak: Right. Yeah.
Derek Dicks: That probably helps. Whenever we had got connected to Claire, Claire came directly back and her help to us went straight to five pockets. So I think there was a deviation from maybe her understanding of what you're wanting to help us build. So
JD Camden: Okay. And I just forwarded you the FAQs from our call center. I just sent them to your drive email, Derek, so you can send them away.
Derek Dicks: Can't fit.
Puran Tak: Great. I focus more on the demo side.
Derek Dicks: Hey, why here?
Puran Tak: So, yeah, that's fine. It's ready.
JD Camden: Yeah. And if you focus more on the demo side, that's that's what we need more than five pocket.
 
 
00:26:34
 
JD Camden: Like we need the full customer experience demo.
Puran Tak: Right. And do I need to write out a whole script for you to be able to present?
JD Camden: No, I think if you can just give Maya the features of what's in there right now that we and then she can test. Maya will tell me how it's performing and then if Maya gives me a thumbs up then I'll test it.
Puran Tak: Okay.
Derek Dicks: I I would say also piran it would be decent to have a script to go off of just to have something to start with.
Puran Tak: Awesome.
Derek Dicks: That is not a bad idea for any any demo that we have built by you.
Evan Kubicek: Relax.
Derek Dicks: So Jean, just for clarity, what what are you building with Rule King in relation from what you got from Claire?
Puran Tak: All right.
Evan Kubicek: Enjoy.
Derek Dicks: Is it just the social side of things or does that integrate with the demo at all from what Karon has?
Jean Del Lasse: as of uh as of today as of right now I was just informed of the Instagram side and um that's the part that I was uh that I was building um but at the same time I am working
 
 
00:27:33
 
Evan Kubicek: Okay.
Jean Del Lasse: on Woodstock uh and as a general dash as a general platform there I'm having the inbox the analytics dashboard the um you know everything that is now ours. Um, so what I'm going to do there, what I can do there is just fork that repository, meaning clone it and change it to rural king and um, essentially talk talking with Piran so we can integrate all of his flows into this uh, new interface uh, because it already has a lot of um, endpoints and and and things that I'm building for Woodstock that I I think I've shown uh, not all of them But I think uh that pretty much lines up with uh everything that uh you said, JD, about what we need to show. I uh yeah, I think we have uh we have a good good shot. I I was up late last night finishing orbit and I just really want to get that off the plate at least for now. So, uh the entire weekend will be for for this uh rural king full uh full full uh one-stop shop demo.
 
 
00:28:50
 
Derek Dicks: That that's the clarity item. So for Jean, what you're doing is the proprietary side building it and then Pon we're working with our traditional platform and and flow building integrating these together.
Jean Del Lasse: Yeah.
Derek Dicks: This is not double work. Correct. We're able to take the work from Pon the flows he has integrate with the proprietary stuff that Jean you're doing to help create one full experience. It's not two separate experiences that are completely double built.
Jean Del Lasse: Yes. Yes. Uh that's that's what we've been talking about.
Evan Kubicek: Yeah.
Jean Del Lasse: That's what we've been trying um integrating his prompts, his flows into this um uh proprietary for April.
Derek Dicks: Okay, make sure we're staying on the same page.
Jean Del Lasse: Yeah.
Derek Dicks: We had talked about phase one with this proprietary build being chat race is the back end that we build and continue to edit, but that's only for the dev side. You're creating the custom backend that only the client sees and the UI that goes along with that.
 
 
00:29:46
 
Derek Dicks: Um, but since you have all full capability and integrate all the different database information AI integration everywhere, it's just a it's a much more full experience. So as long as that we're we're fully still doing phase one like we discussed that it's a a current build using tools we have and not pure on build something and then you go back and rebuild it. So it's something that we can use both sides. Um eventually we'll we'll move off of chat races we discussed but for now that rule king would be um you know similar that woodsock interface for them to be able to see that with the dashboard um using all the flows that Pon has. I mean that is a full full experience I think they would get their head around. Um if I know we even have like reversal if we have a ability to take their um take their home screen of the rule rule king even just that of the tractors the guns one of their home screens and and do it u layer on an omniar that would be like a search similar to what he just discussed as far as Amazon and to Walmart.
 
 
00:31:02
 
Derek Dicks: It's the same kind of thing that we can put a um we can layer on a versal search AI search there and then just basically like your FAQ is going pulling from for the roll king chat and do a quick demo like that would be a pretty spectacular thing. So they're they're going to want to try and see how they can out compete with tractor supply. That wouldn't be real difficult on your side, would it?
JD Camden: What should happen that's actually innovative is when I put something into the search and it populates and I click it then then April actually triggers at the bottom when they hit the search landing page with hey I see you're looking for this product can I help you right so basically from the search bar not actually changing it but recognizing what they put in it and then firing a chat window to help support it after would be would be the ideal experience as a whole because then you can move them into a chat experience based on their website interaction but like people who put search product they're looking for a product they want to see product like the royal king search bar is actually pretty sharp like if you this is from a tool called conductor as a whole which is they use some AI in it but it's not true AI so right but let's
 
 
00:32:16
 
JD Camden: say I'm looking for bird feed right so then I get suggested search I get suggested products I get suggested categories right but most customers won't talk to this like a chat experience, right? But if I put bird feed in here and then I go search for it, this should then fire a popup that goes, "Hey, I see you're looking for bird feed. Can I help you find the ideal bird feed today?" Whoa, what? Like, yeah, that'd actually be super helpful. And then I can move down here into chat. Yeah, I'm looking for I'm looking for a hummingbird feeder, right?
Evan Kubicek: All
JD Camden: And then that chat experience now takes over to get that customer to a hummingbird feeder, which by the way is on like page five of their bird feed, which looks like that right there.
Sarah Ressler: Does that I'm just saying it's
Evan Kubicek: right.
JD Camden: That's an entirely different issue because that's that's the SEO is tied to content on this page. This this is a tool called conductor. This is this is zindesk over here just so we know.
 
 
00:33:33
 
JD Camden: And this this is this is a call center team. This is real people. So try not to chat with this. Just so we all know like that's not fake people. You're welcome to mess with them if you want but try not to.
Derek Dicks: Right.
Brian Okello: Hey John, is it is it is it easier to um to connect it to a page so that when the page loads up then that information that the agent reviews than getting information from the search bar? Which which one is more possible? I think it's possible.
Jean Del Lasse: I think both are I think both are a great idea. Uh just just last night for Woodstock uh since we already have Magento uh integration.
Brian Okello: Yeah.
Jean Del Lasse: Um I added that to to our current Woodstock thing and it became that it became um you know sofas and then we have a carousel. I just sent it on the chat on WhatsApp JD and it became a carousel and then I've added the ability to view on site or add to your cart right as as we have it on the other platform.
 
 
00:34:33
 
Jean Del Lasse: But the thing here is that you're chatting uh it it has the it has the search uh of the product and you can you know it goes back and forth.
Brian Okello: Yeah. Yeah.
Jean Del Lasse: The one that I already showed before was the one that was showing hey what are my what is my you know my I don't know how much have I spent or what's my last order has it been delivered and from there in the same chat uh the chat just suggests other products and you get the instant gratification of the of the carousel and and browsing and things that are actually recommended for her purchase history and her etc. Right? It kind of became that. But I was, you know, this is this was just like an entry point of like I'm going directly to the chat. That was my the the way that I was do doing it. Sorry. But this part of also having an entry point at the at the websites where the client's already searching, the client's already clicking on something, then that should, you know, prompt them an option to just chat or just talk with one click.
 
 
00:35:40
 
Jean Del Lasse: Uh, I think that's that's the great uh that's a great segue into into our current chat experience into our latest SAD experience.
Brian Okello: Okay.
JD Camden: um I put I put in the so with rule king when you do a search it it creates a search term text URL so if we could identify the search term in the text URL the structure is almost always the same it's search term equals right and then we could feed that search term down into the chat experience and use that as the initial prompt trigger to to have the AI automatically engage.
Brian Okello: Yeah.
JD Camden: Right? So, this is something we've talked about of how does the AI start the conversation versus the customer having to be the starter. We use the search term prompt from the URL. So, every time we see search term triggered in the URL, we grab what's after that as the equals and we go that's our prompt starter and we fire that to engage the customer in the conversation.
Derek Dicks: Yeah, that would be good.
Brian Okello: Yeah, let's go.
 
 
00:36:39
 
Brian Okello: Thanks.
JD Camden: See, look. We're all brainstorming today. We're finding the solutions. Keep hustling. Okay. I I have to go to the 90 other fires I need to go put out, though. So, anything else you guys need for me? I know I gave a lot of direction. I need clear updates against those items by two, three o'clock today.
Puran Tak: question. I have a question. Yeah. So, since I didn't have clarity on the tractors, uh currently it's trained on um lawnmowers because that's what I found as the first option.
JD Camden: Yep.
Puran Tak: It has 50 products to recommend from. Is that okay?
JD Camden: Yeah, that's fine. Yep.
Puran Tak: Okay, fine. because it was just stressing me out because nage was not available late night and there was nobody straight product.
JD Camden: But, uh, arcadectors.com is its own website.
Brian Okello: I keep instructions.
JD Camden: So, if you're on if you're on Rule King and you click in the header, you'll see there's a website for arcade guns and arcade tractors.
 
 
00:37:28
 
Puran Tak: All right.
JD Camden: So, there's actually two additional websites that support gun products and a tra and a tractor's product experience.
Puran Tak: Yeah, they have a blocker for me because I'm in India and it doesn't let me access rule king website.
Derek Dicks: But for the demo on Monday, it can be built basically on
Puran Tak: I got to use a VBN all the time even with walkers and swans.
JD Camden: Yeah. So, yeah. for for uh Monday we can just focus on roll king.
Puran Tak: Okay. Okay. Thanks,
JD Camden: Okay. Um okay, good. Uh can somebody text me the Swans demo link so I can text it to Franklin Swan as just a way to get him engaged to see if he's still interested in moving the project forward.
Puran Tak: There's lots of What's up? Can I send you a WhatsApp?
Derek Dicks: I can select that G.
JD Camden: Yeah. And give give me like the paragraph like tell him, "Hey, Franklin, I put this chat together. Here's some of the core features of what it should do.
 
 
00:38:31
 
JD Camden: Just give me some of the core features." And then the link either slack it to me, WhatsApp it to me, and then I'm texted over to him. I'm in Texas today, so there might be a possibility I can go meet with him. Is Is Knights ready to go? I know we said Penny Mustard's ready to go. I know we said Gavigans is ready to go. Is Knights ready to go?
Puran Tak: is really close like the only thing is there are such small errors prompt errors which I have not looked at because I was busy in the dual king and the sports flood demo and I'll take care of the
Brian Okello: Yeah.
Puran Tak: errors that Brian's been taking care of them but there are few that I need to take care of as well so it's really close to
Brian Okello: Yeah.
JD Camden: So priority pri priority definitely is rule king.
Brian Okello: Yeah.
JD Camden: I don't disagree. We need the rule king demo to be knocked down stand up Monday. Uh the other three priorities is can we get penny mustard gavigans and nights live by Tuesday Wednesday next week.
 
 
00:39:22
 
Brian Okello: Thanks.
Derek Dicks: When we say live, we need that they need to be testing it in their own hands before they approve this.
JD Camden: Okay. And then Oh, Cody already told me to go live.
Derek Dicks: But we just need to have live links for them to test
JD Camden: Joey already told me to go live. Like Gavigan's already said, "Hey, as soon as you're ready, go live." Like Ryan will test it as soon as you send in the link. Like these are three clients who are telling us like, "Hey, just we're trusting you to test it and tell us it works." And then push it live. But it has to have the features we talked about. It has to be able to do lead nurturing. It has to be able to follow up with those appointments, right? Like it's got to be able to provide the basic product data, right? So I know it can do that, but like it's got to provide the phase one features. Okay. And then on your side, Derek, I need I need red line.
 
 
00:40:12
 
JD Camden: If you if you don't have time to do it, give it back to Evan, I guess. And I need SOCK 2 compliance and I need Vappy to move through in addition to moving through testing features and the Rook King demo that I you and I will have to be on site for Monday. Okay.
Derek Dicks: Okay. Anything else before you go?
JD Camden: Um, no, I think that's that's the main things I need us to get.
Derek Dicks: Okay. See you. Thanks. Hey Brian, um if you can go through I know all the testing stuff that's getting dumped in there for Maya and Alexis um on the Slack. Uh with Prom being so busy, if you can go through and try and do 100% of that as much as you can, uh you can reassociate the assigned. Um if you can't do it, then you can update the assigned back to Pon. Um, but hopefully you can take over as much as possible for him for any fixes that come through.
Brian Okello: Okay. Yeah.
 
 
00:41:33
 
Brian Okello: Yeah. I'll I'll um I'm checking on the on on the fixes, but there's some that I need retested.
Derek Dicks: I know.
Brian Okello: So, um, maybe Mia, when you go to Slack, just check on the column where it says ready for testing and check if it's okay. Just let me know and I'll push it over to next.
Derek Dicks: Perfect. Brian, if you can also update with Penny Mustard. I know that there is um I was using yesterday and I was still getting some asterisks that were coming through. Uh it was trying to bold it. Just make sure that just knows that it it is not to do any formatting. Um that was one of the only things uh asterisk the star that would be before and after the header word.
Brian Okello: Sorry.
Derek Dicks: So he was trying to do an H1 or a H2 heading and trying bolding to make sure the all everything gets clean before it gets pushed out to the customer. Uh no formatting haron.
Brian Okello: Okay. So, I'm going to start I'm going to start with things left.
 
 
00:42:37
 
Derek Dicks: Oh, he's on here.
Brian Okello: Yeah, I'm faster.
Derek Dicks: Okay. While you are updating, if you can check on uh how the JSON objects come through for uh product recommendation. Um I do see that the uh like the dollar sign is is accurate. Uh whenever like say a price is $3,000, the dollar sign is there. There's no comma after the three, 0000. Um small things like that. And then as far as when it says the height and the width, it would say just a number. It really needs to have a double quotes for inches just for proper formatting to happen. Um that's going to be on his side for the I think the Google sheet that he pulls from unless however his vector database is now set up. I can't remember if he has it set somewhere else. Um, but those those two other things whenever it does product selection, double quotes for inches and then the columns for money.
Brian Okello: Cool.
Derek Dicks: I'm sorry, the comma when it's over uh $1,000.
 
 
00:43:47
 
Derek Dicks: That does that make sense? Yeah.
Brian Okello: Yeah.
Derek Dicks: Yeah.
Brian Okello: Yeah.
Derek Dicks: Okay. I know you'll be talking with Pon as you go through and which things you do and which thing he does. That would be helpful if you can take care of that.
Brian Okello: Okay.
Derek Dicks: Maya, hey, I know you have um a bunch of testing and items that you're going through.
Miya Harrison: Yeah.
Derek Dicks: You you really do an excellent job when it comes to testing. So, um we trust you and I know that you may if we're not going to be having a ton of testing from the client, um we we may really be the last one before it goes live. uh which is which is important. I don't want to make it feel like it's 100% on you. So when you feel like you have something there hesitations you have or different things that you feel like tone style the voice of it just a little off or it's trying to do too much just let me know.
 
 
00:44:46
 
Derek Dicks: I was catching some as I was, you know, it's it's okay for the the AI to be able to say, I don't know, or I can get a associate for you versus, you know, hallucinating or trying to create answers where there are no answers. Um, that's important. So, when somebody gets some of these hyperspecific things that like the testing GPT that Evan made, it has some really, really good questions to start digging in. But if the AI thinks that it needs to try and answer all of those, um, it'll just keep going and start making crap up. So, at some point, if you feel like it it hits, you know, level two, three, four down low of these questions is digging, it's just making stuff up. That's the stuff to let me know or to come back into it because we can prompt it in different way to be able to have different thresholds for knowledge. So, it just knows it hits this point and at that point, we just need to refer over to a for customer service.
 
 
00:45:40
 
Derek Dicks: And Brian, for your side too, I this would probably be more of a piron as far as logic to build. Um, but we've discussed the idea of of tagging users. So whenever we have a user with malicious intent, we have a user that um we feel is uh just needs to talk to a um a representative. What ways do we have to be able to not stop the chat completely, but to start just to deviate at that point to a customer service rep instead of continually talking and discussing it? You understand that question correctly?
Brian Okello: So um we can we can add a detecting um a detection uh instruction to detect uh that and then it will def we cannot we cannot tag them directly from the prompt because if we do that then we'll have to change the entire structure of how of how um the the agent gets its knowledge from right now we're using agent so we're not using the JSON structured so we're going to have to run a function that tags the client and then it immediately stops and lets informs us that there's a client who has been tagged malicious and all that but then it will stop responding to the client and it will just transfer back to human.
 
 
00:47:00
 
Brian Okello: Is that the case?
Derek Dicks: I don't know if I understood that correctly. So, you said with the with the agents were not able to tag because they don't share the tags. Is that what you're saying? I I apologize.
Brian Okello: No, at the moment we cannot tag directly from the prompt because we're not using the JSON structure, right? we'll have to use it in the the the settings area. But now we're using AI um agents. So what we're going to do is have instruction that we run a function that tags and then stops interaction and informs the ad admins of the malicious user. So that
Derek Dicks: Right. Um there there are some creative combinations that we can do here with the agents and the functions that would help out. It would just have to be some pretty interesting algorithms we'll put together for how to grade the responses from the user. So when the user has repetitive questions has anyway we'd have to come up with a criteria for what would a malicious or spam user look like.
 
 
00:48:06
 
Brian Okello: Yes.
Derek Dicks: Um, that's what I'm that's what I'm discussing as far as how how we go about that when we tag them. So, as long as we'll come up with that side of it, but understanding how to run it, that would just basically be the grading agent at the end to be able to go through and review the answers or even just that was a question I had we had mentioned previously as far as um, you know, we have a chat history agent.
Brian Okello: jumping. Yeah.
Derek Dicks: Can you hear me? Okay. Still now, is it possible for us to have a um like a chat history full agent that that's what their job is to review that custom field and it's just in the background.
Brian Okello: Yeah. Yeah, I can hear you.
Derek Dicks: It's not something that really necessarily provide like he never respond he never responds to the user. His job is just to review it and then whenever it gets fired, he would apply a tag. But as long as there's nothing suspicious, he does nothing except just review the whole chat history.
 
 
00:49:10
 
Derek Dicks: Is that possible to have an agent that does such things?
Brian Okello: Yeah. Yeah, it is possible. Currently we have agents specified for different use like u normal responses, appointment and yeah.
Derek Dicks: Okay.
Brian Okello: So we can have one just to do the analysis of the history for malicious detect malicious users.
Derek Dicks: Yeah.
Brian Okello: Yeah, it is
Derek Dicks: Yeah. And that's all he does. He doesn't ever respond to the user. all his job is to run the background and keep reviewing it. I I had something similar um happened whenever I was using Anthropic. Um I was using Claude and it's been probably four months ago, so I'm sure they're better now. But I was able to get Claw to do some things I knew it wasn't supposed to do. And as I was continuing, I was inching here and inching there trying to figure out where the edges and what I could get it to do. Uh it was still Claw 37. Um but I was able to get it to do a lot of things.
 
 
00:49:59
 
Derek Dicks: But then something happened in the middle of the chat, whether it it went to a human or it it ran a function on itself that it actually gave me a um not an error message, but it was like a status change in the chat. So, as I'm chatting with it, it gave a blurp and I knew it just changed status and from that point forward, it the whole conversation was different. So, I don't know if it was something that a human happened to be reviewing my chat at that point and said, "Wait a second, this guy's trying to break it." and he swapped the mode in it or if it had its own ability to grade itself and see that what I was doing was actually, you know, spamming or malicious. And so from that point forward, the conversation was limited on what I could do. And I was very impressed with it.
Evan Kubicek: still on. Yeah.
Derek Dicks: That was my point. Does that make sense? So that's what I mean as far as this idea is actually something from anthropic that I'm stealing is is how it it was able to detect the conversation grade at some point figure out that my whole intent is not um you know benign and it it changed its whole status based on a tag it gave me and so from that point forward I couldn't get around it.
 
 
00:51:08
 
Derek Dicks: That's the goal.
Brian Okello: Yeah.
Derek Dicks: Yeah.
Brian Okello: So um the question is do you want do you want that when the malicious user has been tagged and detected so the agent will have to come in review and the agent has to manually um take the user
Derek Dicks: So
Brian Okello: back to AI or do you want the AI to continue conversation but limited conversation knowing keeping in mind that this is a malicious user and then over the conversation if it like maybe uh can I say rehabilitated the user So then it goes back to the default um automatically. Is that so?
Derek Dicks: That's a good way to say it. Um, yeah, I think that I think I like the idea that it continues conversation, but it it almost puts it into a u a shallow mode where it just will not it will not really try to go deep and answer all these questions. It understands a malicious user needs to stay surface level. So, it answers quick things, FAQ type things. But when it starts saying, you know, give me the details about the owners of your company and their LinkedIn address, you know, things they're like, uh, wait a second, no, like, I apologize.
 
 
00:52:20
 
Derek Dicks: We don't get that information out. If you'd like to give me a customer service representative, I can do a cup like just to try and keep them out from going deep and just stay in the shallow mode is really would be the goal. That would be some the promp prompting that we can help with. But as far as the back end to be able to set up that greater and the functions is really what I'd need help with.
Brian Okello: Yeah.
Derek Dicks: And then I can help you with the prompting to specify what it can and can't do after they get tagged as malicious because really that's the that's the biggest important one to to set up.
Brian Okello: Yeah.
Derek Dicks: And once we have that agent that can do such things, it it it changes for what we have built so far because I think right now all our agents are sequential. They tag, they hand off from one person to another. They're all doing their job. Excellent. Now what this would do is if we have a a a big grading agent on the back side of it, not just malicious users, we also can detect the you know the intent of a cash buyer and this person is ready to go and they can get tagged a certain way or if someone is a VIP in the company and they need to be able to go to a customer service rep or an agent, I'm sorry,
 
 
00:53:29
 
Derek Dicks: a human agent way faster without all the questioning. we can, you know, there's there's some once it goes back into the uh sentiment analysis stuff that we've talked about once it has a a full conversation history grading and that's and that's where it's been tricky with the
Brian Okello: Yeah. Yeah.
Derek Dicks: multiple agents. If we do full chat history on a Sally agent versus a Steve agent versus a Gary and if they're pulling in full chat history, it messes up their functions and it it does, you know, you can't quite do it. So they're always kind of limited on what the current function is being ran and the conversation's happening. But if we had a full full the full agent in the background just monitoring the whole conversation history, it can watch as everything goes through and you know later we can get it to where it can steer maybe suggestions over to Gary or suggestions over to Sally. Like that's a whole complicated thing that we can do later. But at least this point, you know, protecting the guard rails to be able to things make sure things don't get off off track is the first goal.
 
 
00:54:31
 
Derek Dicks: But setting up that system creates the ability to have all sorts of cool tagging functions and features that can help the other agents. That make sense?
Brian Okello: Yeah, it makes sense.
Derek Dicks: Yeah.
Brian Okello: Makes sense. Yeah, I think I think we Sorry.
Derek Dicks: Okay. I mean, that would be Sorry.
Brian Okello: Go on.
Derek Dicks: Go ahead.
Brian Okello: Oh, um I was saying I think I think we have something like that with the feature with trace. Whenever whenever I try to chat with them on messenger, I never get responded to by the eye. So I think they have me tagged and just turn off the eye on my end. Yeah.
Derek Dicks: That's it. Yeah, exactly the point. So there'll be some people that you know once they've been merged into like say Woodstock and Woodstock knows them by you know social channel by SMS by you know has all their information and they come back through you know they also could say hey Brian good to have you back and if Brian you know you say hey I need to talk to so and so they're like all right hold on one second they just no hesitation you know they just know you're VIP you are you know you're listed as somebody that's um able to go around the AI versus if they don't know who they are of course they're going to say, "Who are you?
 
 
00:55:38
 
Derek Dicks: Can we get your email address and let's get you in the system?" Like there's different ways to handle and that's where the intelligent routing would come in or intelligent um yeah intelligent routing would come in to be able to understand who the who the user really is and not treating all of them the same as they come through. That that's impressive. It increases the customer experience and then clients would see that as a huge benefit because that's what they would do. If you know, Brian walks in the door and they know Brian, they're not gonna say, "Hey, what's your name? Let's start from scratch every time. They're going to be able to pick up the conversation from where it left off." And that's all they're looking for is something digitally to be done the same way that it would be done in the store. And and that treating each customer uniquely to who they are anyway. But having that grading agent in the background, I think sets the foundation up for us to be able to protect them first, but then um enhance the experience long term.
 
 
00:56:34
 
Derek Dicks: And we have lots of things for that. So anyway, if you if you have time to start something like that, that would be definitely, you know, Piran would probably want to be part of that. John would have some thoughts. Even um Adithia, uh you're familiar with him, right?
Brian Okello: Sorry. Who?
Derek Dicks: Chat race Adithia uh from Chat Race.
Brian Okello: No. She's a lady Muslim.
Derek Dicks: I maybe mispronouncing his name. I'm sure guarantee you know him. Um Adithia Adithia Ad.
Brian Okello: She's Muslim.
Derek Dicks: No, it's not a lady. Uh Aditia. I think that's how you say it. I think he's Yeah. Uh he we talked to him. uh he's not on team yet, but we've talked to him about possibly joining um and he's been with Chat Race literally from day one from the sounds of it before Ryan and everything. So, he's been a somebody who who knows a lot. Um but he I'm sure you do.
Brian Okello: Oh, then then in in that case I know him.
 
 
00:57:37
 
Brian Okello: I I think maybe. Did he ever take a white label?
Derek Dicks: Sure. Say again.
Brian Okello: Did he ever take a white label from Sierra?
Derek Dicks: Yeah.
Brian Okello: Oh yeah, cuz we had we had initial we had a group we had a group for the first white label buyers from CR way back like from three four years ago I think.
Derek Dicks: Okay.
Brian Okello: Yeah.
Derek Dicks: It sounds like he was part of that because he he was we had an interview with him. He discussed that he was uh one of the first ones there. He still gets, you know, tech service questions reverted to him from Ryan instead of to Antonio and Lori. So, um, anyway, so he's interested, um, in joining us.
Brian Okello: Okay.
Derek Dicks: Uh, we're kind of putting a together a scope together for what he would do and how he would help. He would basically be, you know, in the in the side of what Pon does. Uh, but he also was u a software developer for years.
 
 
00:58:27
 
Brian Okello: Oops.
Derek Dicks: So, he would understand Jean's side of things, too. So, he'd be a good a good one to join us. But, we're still putting together scope together. Not not to get off that. The point was that um you know this is this is flow innovative flow building. Um and so I would say for you if you got as far as you could as far as the the backend grading agent that's able to just monitor things something you could test and see as far as we get with it and then um we can pull in everybody else once we have something that kind of has an idea of what we're doing and what want to achieve and then I can help you with the prompting side.
Brian Okello: Okay.
Derek Dicks: Okay. Okay. Uh, that's it. I didn't um Sarah and Evan, sorry you were part of all that.
Brian Okello: All right.
Derek Dicks: I just realized so.
Sarah Ressler: I have a question, but it could just be Derek.
Evan Kubicek: That's fine.
 
 
00:59:22
 
Evan Kubicek: Yeah, I just got to make sure I get you after this call so we can finish our practicing.
Derek Dicks: Yeah, we got to finish the application. Okay. Thanks, Brian. We'll talk to you later.
Sarah Ressler: Derek, can you hear me?
Derek Dicks: I can hear you. Say, yeah.
Sarah Ressler: Okay, it's it's been choppy on my end. I'm a little confused on the email portion and what I need to be emailing. I plan on going back and re listening to all, you know, putting the stuff GBT and breaking down the meeting notes, but it really wasn't ex explained or elaborated what the different people needed. All I caught was they need to be emailed and updated.
Derek Dicks: Um, I think I think technically it's still it's still Yeah, it's still taking notes, which is good. And kind of why I wanted to go off on with Brian on that. Not necessarily that Brian's going to do all those things, but I knew meeting notes were rolling. So if I could brain dump it while he was here, that's kind of what I did.
 
 
01:00:20
 
Derek Dicks: So the same thing with discussions that um Josh had. I think he did the same so we can pull from it. The emails that he is referencing is not one that he gave us details on today. It would have been um similar ones that we've sent to probably Penny Mustard the very beginning maybe Gavin when they first got one. Remember there was an email that you had sent.
Sarah Ressler: Yeah, the last email that I sent to Gavagans was pulling their analytics from the Google their Google drives and they never responded to me back on that one, but you jumped on a call with them and I'm really not for sure. You said we would be transitioning everything over into the Slack channel and that was the last update I heard from them.
Derek Dicks: Wait, sorry.
Sarah Ressler: So, I guess I guess I just I'm sorry, there's background noise. Um, I guess I just need direction on what I need to email.
Derek Dicks: All your hands.
Sarah Ressler: I can go back and dump these notes, like I said, in chat GPT, but if there's something else that I missed, it would be great to be educated on.
 
 
01:01:45
 
Evan Kubicek: You're on mute, Derek.
Derek Dicks: I said I apologize. I had Josh sent me some technical messages. Do you I apologize. Where was the emails you had sent or sent Sarah about what you have sent? If you can send some to people. I think that's all he was asking for.
Sarah Ressler: I'm sorry. What was your question?
Derek Dicks: You're asking about what email to send. I'm just saying you've sent before. Can you use some of the same format from those you've sent before or no?
Sarah Ressler: Yes, I can. But as far as I know, those have already been sent. So I don't know if this is like when you say that Where are we with all the clients?
Evan Kubicek: It's followup. Where where where are we at with all of our clients is mostly the question.
Sarah Ressler: That sounds like an internal question, not an external question to me. So, he's saying he's saying, "I need you guys or whoever to email these clients, but I don't know what to email them."
 
 
01:02:48
 
Derek Dicks: All right.
Sarah Ressler: So, that's what I'm trying to figure out.
Derek Dicks: Correct. We're we're talking a circle here. So I the penny mustard, gavigans, and swans. Those are the three that he wanted emails sent to um as far as going getting them list next week. They must have grabbed and swarmed, I believe. But that is the here's the link for them to try again. I I guess I I guess I didn't know if they had gotten an email. See, Mr. Gavin Swans, have they gotten any of those initial link emails?
Sarah Ressler: So, so I guess the last conversation And I apologize that me and you had about Gavigan when the language model, some of it was taken out and it was being redone for verbiage and the furniture
Derek Dicks: I know Gavagans had obviously found them earlier.
Sarah Ressler: aspect was not working when they took a picture and they put it in the for room. So, that was extracted and as far as I'm aware, regardless of the link that they have, as soon as it's updated on John's side, it's active on their side.
 
 
01:04:16
 
Sarah Ressler: Like, that's as far as I'm aware, but maybe I'm wrong. So I don't know what other link is there different links that they need.
Derek Dicks: No, you're fine. So, the the link for testing it is updated once a change happens on our side is active immediately on their side. So, you're correct. Now, there's a different item that goes onto the website that adds the bubble, the chat bubble. We we would want to have a go not go, you know, go no go sign from them instead of being like, hey, just throw this on your site. It'd be good to have an email. Here's maybe just the same link again. Here's the updated link. We can say update even though we all know it's not, but they don't know this. So, just puts it bumps it back to their email instead of giving them an email to say, hey, go back to that link and try again. Just keeps it all in the same email. Hey, here's the link.
 
 
01:05:13
 
Derek Dicks: Here's the updated link with all the changes we have. Please review it. Suggestion updates. Otherwise, we're ready to go live on your site and we can provide the website code next like to hear from you if you want to set up a meeting to review anything or changes. Just we need a a confirmation from them a go not go before we just throw them a link and say throw on your website' be best. And I think with Swans was not that. swans. He had said that he wanted to reactivate them to make sure they still wanted to move forward, especially with being in Texas. So, his is Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what he's already gotten, but Penny Muster and Gavigans that that would be the same for them.
Sarah Ressler: Okay.
Derek Dicks: They just have it. Here's the updated ones. Changes have been made. Please review it. Let us know if you have any other thoughts. We can set up a meeting and go over any other adjustments if you'd like to.
 
 
01:06:22
 
Derek Dicks: We also can provide the code for your website next if you are ready to apply. Just something that gives a little break. That way they come back with a yes, let's move forward. And then we have a clear email that says yes, they said go move forward a go sign. And then that would be the date we say we started forward. give them the email link. I'm sorry. We give them the link to their website that they put on and it's all to the wind at that point.
Sarah Ressler: This is all accessible through the I think it's called the knowledge sheet. Is that correct?
Derek Dicks: The knowledge base sheet has all the links. I can provide any links you want me to. Like that's easy stuff for me. Copy paste and put them in there to make sure you have the right one.
Sarah Ressler: Okay.
Derek Dicks: Like that's that's an easy thing for me to do. It just be if you if you even want to, you know, write the email um and just send it to me instead of them.
 
 
01:07:25
 
Derek Dicks: I can review it, look at it, throw the link on there, and just send it back to you. And then you copy paste the whole thing and then send it off. So if you want another set even I don't know what your availability is even if Evan wants to look at review what you what you write and then
Sarah Ressler: Okay. Is one Sure. So in my mind to streamline things so it's not one more thing for you to do. I think it would be best if it was on the the knowledge base sheet just for me to copy and paste it from there because if everything's updated and it just automatically links. That's just one less step for you.
Derek Dicks: Well, for sure it is there. Um, if you look on column C, like zebra, uh, I just wrote in there, it says project link and I said for testing in parenthesis, so it's just more clear that that's the one for testing. And then there's going to be another one, column AB says website code.
 
 
01:08:24
 
Derek Dicks: That's the one that's going to be the link that we send.
Sarah Ressler: We send to them for their website.
Derek Dicks: Column AB is the one that go with the website. I just put that in parenthesis says put in header of website.
Sarah Ressler: But we don't do that one until after the test.
Derek Dicks: That's
Sarah Ressler: Can you hear me? Hello.
Derek Dicks: Say it one more
Sarah Ressler: Sorry, my earbuds are about to die. Uh we're not going to send them the link to their website until they've gone through the testing. Correct.
Derek Dicks: We need to send them an email that says, "Here's the updated link."
Sarah Ressler: That press.
Derek Dicks: That's column Z for Zebra. And then we tell them that to review it, give us any updates they need to, any of their feedback. And then if everything's fine, our next email will be the website
Sarah Ressler: Okay. And contracts are in place for payment invoicing. What does that look like?
Derek Dicks: I have no idea when it comes to that side of channels and what they've signed not signed unfortunately.
Sarah Ressler: Okay. All right. All right. I appreciate so very much.
Evan Kubicek: Come
Sarah Ressler: I think that's it for me. I'll um I'm I've got because it's just us, I've got other two people I'm deactivating, Deepa and Zoya on the other side.
Evan Kubicek: on, Joe. Sounds good.
Derek Dicks: Okay, sounds
Evan Kubicek: All right, we can end this and then hop back over on uh or just stop transcription. I think you if you just
