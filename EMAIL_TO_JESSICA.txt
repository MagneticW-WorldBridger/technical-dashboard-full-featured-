Subject: Woodstock Chat - FIXED (Stable Now)

Hi Jessica,

Thank you for the detailed report. I've immediately stabilized production:

✅ FIXED (Deployed 2 minutes ago):
- Chat box positioning restored
- Product search working correctly
- Leather sofas displaying properly
- All carousel rendering functional

WHAT HAPPENED:
- Recent frontend updates caused rendering conflicts
- Backend was 100% functional (confirmed via testing)
- Rolled back frontend to last stable version
- Your team can resume testing NOW

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ All basic features working
✅ Product search with carousels
✅ Customer recognition via LOFT API
✅ All 25+ functions operational

NEXT 3 DAYS (Careful Re-Implementation):
• Day 1 (Today): STABLE - team can test
• Day 2 (Tomorrow): Re-add authentication features (tested incrementally)
• Day 3 (Wed): Malcolm's staging integration

The system is stable and ready for your team to use right now.

Let me know if you see any other issues - I'm monitoring production closely.

Best,
Jean
