Robin Graham: What is your thoughts on that Jessica?
Jessica Carrasquillo: So in general, the web team, the whole team actually has access to all store locations because we don't have as full team members at the other ones, just Aworth.
Robin Graham: Okay.
Jessica Carrasquillo: So they'll kind of take care of a lot of the conversations. If someone wants to go in store, then they have the person there as well. But um they do have access. So people kind of don't fall through the cracks if the one person at Hyram isn't available for chat.
Robin Graham: Right.
Jessica Carrasquillo: Yeah.
Robin Graham: Okay.
Jessica Carrasquillo: So there would be one specific team that could see all locations.
Derek Dicks: Yeah, it's Yeah, whoever's in charge of that one master, it it's okay to have more than less as far as eyes on it just in case.
Robin Graham: Okay.
Derek Dicks: Uh just for that backing idea.
Robin Graham: Perfect. Okay.
Jessica Carrasquillo: Yeah.
Robin Graham: Then it would be myself and Renee and we can get you her information and potentially even Victoria on that Jessica just so it's more eyes.
 
 
00:01:02
 
Jessica Carrasquillo: Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Um management over them definitely
Derek Dicks: So that so master inbox would be Jessica, Robin, Renee, and Victoria would be a starting point.
Robin Graham: Yeah.
Derek Dicks: Of course, we could always adjust things later or add more people too. Uh so that'd be a starting point for the master view of the whole inbox.
Robin Graham: Right.
Derek Dicks: As far as the store specific teams, um, how many locations you have? I apologize.
Robin Graham: We have six locations. Four furniture and then two mattresses. Two mattress stores.
Derek Dicks: Okay. Um, in each one of those four, are they going to have one inbox owner or one inbox team? Each individual Okay.
Robin Graham: Yes. to um correct because to Jessica's point, each store has their own what we call a web team member and they're kind of a hybrid role for the most part except for the two mattress stores and the mattress stores, as you can imagine, they don't see uh the amount of traffic that the furniture store sees.
 
 
00:02:02
 
Robin Graham: So, they have the time to manage that of things that come in for them specifically.
Colin Vander Veen: We are we not including the DC1 uh customer support in this because this is kind of first line of defense or something.
Jessica Carrasquillo: Oh no, Colin, that's actually a great point.
Robin Graham: Yeah, that is a good point.
Jessica Carrasquillo: Yeah, we also have a warehouse inbox for our customer service department.
Colin Vander Veen: You still got customer support. Yeah.
Jessica Carrasquillo: No, sorry.
Derek Dicks: I'm sorry. Say that again. Apologize.
Jessica Carrasquillo: Um to Colin's point, we also another location inbox basically is our customer service. They have had their own and they are actually located at our warehouse, our distribution center. So that would be another inbox, right?
Colin Vander Veen: Yeah, it's not a store, but it's a group.
Derek Dicks: Are they a that's gonna be a group? What per I mean we can get permissions I guess settled up later. I was going to try and get a full list of some names. You have emails to go with them and then which team or which inbox they'd be uh responsible to see.
 
 
00:03:01
 
Derek Dicks: Some of that is permissions. So when I say you know the admin uh inbox, I just mean somebody who has all permissions to see all inboxes. But then if it's just, you know, furniture one inbox, that's going to be they're only going to have permissions to just see that one inbox.
Robin Graham: Gotcha.
Derek Dicks: So, uh, permissions and inbox I'm kind of using interchangeably. So, sorry if that's confusing.
Robin Graham: No. And that would be correct because they wouldn't have um a view of everybody. We would only want a view of customer service.
Derek Dicks: Okay. Hey, Jean, this is a good point to pull you in as far as how you're building the the inbox permissions on that.
Jessica Carrasquillo: Please.
Derek Dicks: Is that something that they'll have access to as you know Robin would be a master admin that she can adjust their permissions or is that something that we will need to set up for them completely.
Jean De Lasse: Uh, no. Actually, we uh give you guys um a UI for that. Um, we're finishing it up.
 
 
00:03:56
 
Derek Dicks: Good.
Jean De Lasse: It essentially will allow you to manage uh you know you guys admins will have access to this admin panel to uh add users, remove users, activate, deactivate them uh and and handle the the permissions. Yes.
Derek Dicks: And as far as location, uh, to go back to my point of permissions and inbox, I'm using those almost interchangeably. Will they be able to set up their inboxes themselves or can we give them a head start and set up some inboxes and they funnel people into those? What what what do you feel like best case scenario for what you build?
Jean De Lasse: Uh yeah, if if you guys have a you know, if it's already defined how many we need to create their names, you know, the location they correspond to, uh we can create those and uh yeah, kind of give you a head start and maybe even if you want to give us the the the users uh that will need access to what, right? And we can give it to you like in that current configuration uh with clear instructions on how to change it in the future.
 
 
00:05:02
 
Derek Dicks: Oh, and then they could be they can go in and adjust it. So, we have like an admin team, a CS team, and then six uh location teams. You'll eat four for furniture and two for mattress. as a starting point. Does that sound correct, Robin?
Robin Graham: Yes. Then to in addition to the um customer service team as they mentioned which would be our distribution center
Derek Dicks: Well, they they'll be able to see to get clarity on like they're looking at customer service for only on that side. They're not actually um like mattress like you have the mattress and furniture stores. They're not going to be looking at those chats. They're going to have their own individualized ones.
Robin Graham: well as if a customer comes in. So let me walk this through just so I understand. So if a customer comes in through the website but they have an issue with a product and they start interfacing with April, the customer themselves are not really specifically requesting the distribution center. So would that automatically because they're seeing there's a problem maybe an issue.
 
 
00:06:11
 
Derek Dicks: correct. That's Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up.
Robin Graham: Okay.
Derek Dicks: Like um triggers would probably be the the word we're familiar with. So any kind of different triggers like that that we would be able to go see as uh April's looking through over the context of the conversation sees that anything that has to do with warranty, repair, damage, something broke, like words like that that it starts steering it towards or tagging it into the customer service team.
Robin Graham: Right. Okay. All right. Perfect.
Derek Dicks: You can still say in your major admin, but those are those are things that um we some of this will be, you know, as we as we test and and and play with it to see how sensitive it needs to be as far as, you know, may overtag or maybe undertag, but we can kind of get that sweet spot as we we roll with it, see kind of the words people use.
Robin Graham: Okay, perfect.
Derek Dicks: But yeah, if that's if that matches up with what you're thinking could work for you, that that is definitely possible.
 
 
00:07:04
 
Robin Graham: Yes, I think so. Colin, Jessica, do you have anything in addition to that for that particular thing?
Colin Vander Veen: Not until we see a kind of roll some more. But I mean I kind of sometimes I think of the customer service kind of as another store even though it's it's just a whole another department.
Derek Dicks: Yeah.
Colin Vander Veen: But because I mean like you said I don't think anybody's going to come they're going to come in from the website or from or towards a store probably in the beginning unless we have some interface you know thing on the web that takes them right into customer service.
Robin Graham: right?
Colin Vander Veen: I mean, I guess it just it really because I guess the you know the if it's the chat bot on the website, it's on the website. I mean, it's not anywhere really yet. So, we'll see.
Derek Dicks: Yeah. And as we expand out of there, um it'll it will live on your Facebook page if you choose to put it there too.
 
 
00:07:50
 
Colin Vander Veen: It changes.
Derek Dicks: So whenever somebody does a Facebook message, it can automatically respond to those for you. Basically do whatever the web chat would do and you'd have the same ability to throw it into inboxes and tag it there. So all these different channels is the goal to try and funnel it all in all the different areas.
Jean De Lasse: uh as a quick follow-up question um the impost is currently used by customer support uh team uh well I guess the question is would it be helpful for the team to have the you know the same inbox there any conversations that need their attention maybe put in a special category or or a different section so they can just go in there and see the ones that are transferred to them. Um because I I remember I'm just asking because initially I remember that you guys mentioned that you have a chat uh team uh during normal business hours that is pretty quick to to reply to these conversations. So, I'm just wondering if by any chance the software that they use to respond um or is it uh via web or is it via phone that you guys maybe don't need an inbox for it?
 
 
00:09:12
 
Jessica Carrasquillo: So typically what happens the chat will come in and then the main team obviously will see it first respond and if it needs customer service the customer service is treated as a location inbox and it gets transferred over to that inbox from the initial team. But basically, April is taking care of that initial contact, recognizing it would need to be transferred to that quote unquote location, inbox type of thing.
Derek Dicks: And who's currently that inbox? Is it is it is that where podium kicks in or who is where you guys are what platform is handling that for you now?
Jessica Carrasquillo: That's it's still podium. It's just like our podium has each store is an inbox location.
Derek Dicks: Okay. Yeah.
Jessica Carrasquillo: Customer service is also a location.
Derek Dicks: Okay.
Jessica Carrasquillo: It's our distribution center.
Derek Dicks: Cool. Okay, then that's totally replaceable. Good. We can combine all that together. Well, that's very helpful. That's gonna Yeah, that's going to get some stuff that we can set up in the background and just have it ready.
 
 
00:10:12
 
Derek Dicks: And um I'll put this in Slack as well, so it could be an easy place for someone to start throwing emails and names. And um even if Jessica, if you're real familiar with how it's already currently broken up would be gold just to be like this is what we're used to. This is the team. These are the names. This is the team. These are the names. And we can go ahead and funnel that together. So when you walk in the least amount different is the goal. So we can go ahead and prep that for you.
Jessica Carrasquillo: Yeah, that's great. I think again we're we're reaching the point we'll want to pull, uh, Renee in. So, uh, and she'll be very helpful because I, I mean, I helped with our web chat from when we set it up for five
Derek Dicks: Okay.
Robin Graham: All
Jessica Carrasquillo: years, but now it's been a little bit since I'm involved in their current processes. So, very familiar with how it's set up and how it's functions, but maybe there's more insight she'll be able to share on how they actually utilize it right now.
 
 
00:11:02
 
Robin Graham: right.
Derek Dicks: Is Renee in that Slack channel already?
Jessica Carrasquillo: I don't believe so. Um I don't think she is on any of our sacks. Her email is Renee re neswan with two ns at Woodstock outlet. Um
Derek Dicks: Okay, I'll go ahead and add her in and then uh whenever she accepts it, uh I'll go ahead and still put some of the stuff in the Slack, but then I'll specifically tag her about the setting up unless you guys get to that first. Um yeah, anything we can do to mirror what you guys have currently, I think would be a good win. It's going to help, you know, buy in from the rest of the team if they don't walk in and go, "What is all of So as much similarity as possible is going to help the transition. Okay,
Robin Graham: Right. I agree.
Jessica Carrasquillo: Yep.
Derek Dicks: perfect. Um, so is there anything else? Jean, we could probably just take some time with Jessica, but I guess maybe Robin and and team, do you guys have any questions for us before we start talking maybe some more technical stuff?
 
 
00:12:06
 
Robin Graham: No. No. Are we fully So, Jessica, have you been able to use Did we get a new uplink class Friday and able to start using that?
Jessica Carrasquillo: When I tried the link on Friday that we had, it still was not connected. Has that been connected since to be able to answer information about product yet or suggestions?
Jean De Lasse: Um so yes um yes right now uh the system is is um recommending products based on uh a simple carousel. Um but yes, on that on that front um we uh we didn't have much of a of an added function this this week.
Derek Dicks: Yeah, I think that's with uh connecting if there's any I know Malcolm, Jessica, and John. Um I think John, did you send the email out to coordinate with everybody today or yesterday?
Jean De Lasse: Uh yeah. Yeah. I I sent a quick email earlier today.
Derek Dicks: Super super. So, um there should be a link or something in there, Jessica, if you want to look at that or if you uh we can just collaborate through email um to see about a time to get everybody together.
 
 
00:13:21
 
Derek Dicks: I think that's like the last just hurdle is is combining all brains together.
Jessica Carrasquillo: Yep, I did see that earlier. Made a note.
Derek Dicks: Super. Um, okay. So, that I think that's going to be the the biggest next rock to get out of the way and then we'll be able to move some stuff forward a lot faster once that gets integrated in there. It's the magic of API stuff together coming together.
Robin Graham: Yes.
Jessica Carrasquillo: Okay.
Derek Dicks: Um, do you have any questions John for Jessica in regards to anything on their her side or is it dependent upon Malcolm as well?
Jean De Lasse: Um, actually, I think um um yeah, no, I think if we uh well, Jessica, I'm sorry. If I could send you another email uh send you guys another email with um just two or three, right? I have just two or three uh scenarios, right? uh where we're going through the entire end-to-end flow, right? uh scenarios that you know where they're just maybe uh asking around and there are other some more complex scenarios where they um you know they're asking about their orders and and product discovery customer support uh and I would just like to run these by you uh so we can start getting a set of rules that you know first of all authentication right uh when we solve this part uh of inheriting the authentication from the magenta website
 
 
00:14:58
 
Jean De Lasse: that'll be um you know that'll give us a very clean space to to to work on the tools that the user can can um will utilize. Um so yeah that's that's it.
Jessica Carrasquillo: Okay.
Jean De Lasse: I uh if I could just have uh your attention on that email later today uh and anyone that could um uh you know pitch in as far as uh well maybe this is not the way it would go or uh maybe customers don't normally uh ask for this they ask for you know this other part and you know most of it of course I guess 80% of it will be common sense but that 20% is what
Jessica Carrasquillo: All right.
Jean De Lasse: we are needing uh that that 20% of very specific, very proprietary processes. We just want to be fully uh full fully compliant with what you guys have, right? Uh just as any other employee that would be on an inbox, right? Pretty much that's uh what we what we want to get at.
Jessica Carrasquillo: Yeah, absolutely.
 
 
00:15:59
 
Jessica Carrasquillo: Um I know just before this call, um Malcolm hadn't been on that previous email you sent, so I did loop him into that. You may be able to help bring some light to a couple of those questions as well.
Derek Dicks: Thank you.
Colin Vander Veen: And I mean, I saw the one about the I don't know if you said discrepancy or just the differences of customers, but yeah, we know. I mean, there's no there's no real way to line those up. Perfect. Anyways, so that was to try to help answer that question. Um, I can't remember where that document went. Um, one of the one of your concerns or questions I guess was about the Anyway. Yeah. So that Yeah. I don't I mean I don't know what to right Jessica. I mean they're two different groups of people and we try to line them up.
Jessica Carrasquillo: Right. So, but if they haven't made an account to link, then there is there's nothing really that can line them up.
 
 
00:17:02
 
Colin Vander Veen: Yeah. Oh, no. You said found significant customer overlap. Well, I hope I would love to see a 100% overlap.
Jean De Lasse: Yeah, exactly.
Colin Vander Veen: Uh, so I don't know what you meant by that question.
Jean De Lasse: Yeah. No, just uh the the the question was really just at the at the later uh stage where uh like Jessic said uh as far as authentication um just wanted to make sure that you know I was confirming well the chat or April can confirm that a user is authenticated uh and then once they are authenticated uh because Malcolm shared the full uh well I don't even know if it's the full but he shared a series of endpoints right that are accessible as admins And uh first just we wanted some clarity on what users will be able to access um and if there's already something in place where uh you know what we discussed where if a user is logging in then they can only see their data nothing uh nothing else should should drip into the conversation or or leak rather into the conversation.
 
 
00:18:17
 
Jean De Lasse: Um, so just wondering if there was already something in how you guys have that uh process set up that handles that
Colin Vander Veen: Well, yes. So, so, and Jessica can hopefully back me up on this, but the you know, a customer on the website, if you're going to authenticate initially on the website, then you're dealing with the web uh you know, the the credentials on the website, which have nothing to do with Loft other than a field in Loft that should eventually, if not sooner than later, have, especially after an order, have a a loft loft ID in it which marries that website user to a loft user which then gets you into the actual loft order information. So there's a a set of I think it's a multi one to many type of a setup so that a one one web log in profile can have multiple loft um uh customer ids is that correct Jessica
Jean De Lasse: catch.
Jessica Carrasquillo: I believe that is correct because I know that he had um but I mean this yeah this is what we discussed last meeting was getting with Malcolm to discuss the uh the authentication I believe.
 
 
00:19:29
 
Colin Vander Veen: that's what we wanted but Oh, okay. Yeah. So, let's Yeah, there's no sense. Let's get him. There's no sense. Sorry, I didn't mean to jump on that one.
Jessica Carrasquillo: No, no, you're you're good. I just Yeah, that's I'm just making sure that you're you're not trying to come up uh bring up a different point that I'm not understanding, right?
Colin Vander Veen: No, I I it's all the same kind of thing we talked about, which was how do we how do we authenticate or not we, but how does April authenticate with this person? You know, you can't just start giving out phone numbers and and and and addresses and order information to somebody. Um, don't want to get in trouble uh or cause some pro problems or whatever. uh or give the wrong information for that matter. Hey, when's my delivery coming? Oh, today. Oh, okay, great. I'll drive home. Uh um yeah.
 
 
00:20:25
 
Colin Vander Veen: So, so yeah, that we got to get with him again. Sorry.
Derek Dicks: Perfect. Okay. Well, that that will be the the the major major push for this week will be to get that together and then we'll get inbox stuff mapped out. um at least the starting point, but once we get Renee in there, I think that'll help push things forward for that direction, too.
Robin Graham: Perfect.
Jessica Carrasquillo: Great.
Derek Dicks: Okay. Some quick clarity. Anything else?
Jessica Carrasquillo: Um, no.
Robin Graham: No, not from my side. Go ahead, Jess.
Jessica Carrasquillo: I was going to say not for me, but should I just go ahead and still use that calendar link in there and set up a time? We can get Malcolm on the phone as well.
Derek Dicks: Uh with that one. Yeah. John, is that is that the my calendar link that you put in there with her?
Jean De Lasse: Uh, yes. The one. Yes.
Derek Dicks: Yep.
Jean De Lasse: When you shared
 
 
00:21:17
 
Derek Dicks: Yep, that'll work. John and I will always be available for that one. Um depending on if we need to pull in JD or anybody else, we can do that. But that that'll be a perfect starting point.
Jessica Carrasquillo: Okay, sounds good. I'll get that scheduled.
Derek Dicks: And then I um I'm also go ahead and put in Slack in case anything else comes up. You had put some specific uh CRM uh fields that were going to be required. Um that's awesome. I confirmed that those were all possible, but I'd like to keep that almost like visual. So, if anything else comes up that you guys can think of, we can add more than that. We would have some on our side too that we would probably recommend, but um just to keep that visual, I think it might be helpful as this continues on to keep it fresh. So, I'm going to put that in the Slack channel as well.
Robin Graham: All right. Thanks, Eric.
Derek Dicks: Cool. All right. Well, uh I don't think we have anything else on our side. You guys have anything else?
